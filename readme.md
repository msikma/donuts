Donuts - Minimalist task framework
==================================

**Note: don't use this yet. It's still in alpha and most work
has not been done yet.**

This is a very simple task runner framework designed to help you quickly
set up powerful build scripts. It's designed around the following core
principles:

* This is a framework for making scripts; you don't invoke Donuts by typing
  `donuts <task>` on the command line, you write your own script that
  utilizes the Donuts module.
* Build scripts should be rather specific and simple. Once they start doing
  too many things, it's best to split them up.
* Simplicity is key: if you want to, you can just run a JS function in response
  to a command-line argument. Or if you want more power, you can configure
  a plugin.
* Donuts does not self-advertise. End users running your build scripts don't
  need to know it exists.

You can set up a Donuts script from scratch in a few minutes, even if you're
new to the framework. It aims to have very quick startup times tooâ€”no
unnecessary task loading or processing is done.

Donuts is mainly inspired by Grunt, but approaches the concept of task running
from a slightly different angle. Tasks may use plugins, or they may not.
Tasks don't have "targets" like they do in Grunt; if you want to run a plugin
with multiple configurations, just write multiple tasks that use the same
plugin. Also, Donuts uses a standard Unix script interface.

Example
-------

Let's say you want to write a build script that can copy over some files
and start a simple Express server to host them. Make a new file called
`build.js` (or whatever name you prefer) and add the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
var Donuts = require('donuts');

// Basic script information that's shown on ./build.js --help
var options = {
  'version': '1.0',
  'description': 'My first build script.',
  'epilog': 'For more info, visit <https://github.com/me/my-app>.'
};

// Define the tasks. This is an array since the order is preserved.
var tasks = [
  {
    'name': 'copy-files', // can be any name
    'help': 'Copies over build files.'
    'task': ['copy', { // plugin-defined options go here
      'src': './static/**/*',
      'dest': './build/'
    }]
  },
  {
    'name': 'dev',
    'help': 'Runs an Express server for development purposes.',
    'task': ['express', { // insert lots of options here
    }]
  }
];

// We can define some optional arguments too, but not in this example.
var args = [];

// Now all that needs to be done is invoke the Donuts module
// and call its run() method.
var buildScript = new Donuts(options, tasks, arguments);
buildScript.run();
```

This script can then be run like any standard Unix script, responding
to `--help` to display its capabilities.

    $ chmod +x ./build.js    # do this once to make it executable
    $ ./build.js --help

This shows the following output:

```
output goes here
```

As simple as the above script is, there are quite a few options that can be
used when defining tasks. The purpose is to provide quite a bit of flexibility
for use in real-world complex applications, without complicating the API.
